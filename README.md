# SFW Bluesky Client

This is a modified version of the Bluesky client with enforced NSFW content filtering. The modification ensures that NSFW content is always hidden, regardless of user preferences.

## How It Works

This repository contains custom modifications to the official Bluesky client that:

1. Override user preferences to always hide NSFW content
2. Modify the ContentHider component to hide adult content
3. Remove options to show NSFW content in the preferences UI
